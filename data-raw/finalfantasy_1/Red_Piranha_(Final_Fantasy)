The '''Red Piranha''', also known as the '''R.CARIBE''' in the ''[[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]]'' version, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It appears in all the river areas in the world, sometimes occasionally alongside [[Piranha (Final Fantasy)|Piranhas]], or the enemy [[White Croc]] once the [[party]] obtains the [[canoe]] from the [[Circle of Sages]] in [[Crescent Lake]]. It is the complementary palette swap of the Piranha, having green fins and a red body. It has more [[HP (stat)|HP]] than its counterpart, and has some [[Defense (stat)|Defense]]. It is also stronger because it does not have a [[Thunder (ability)|Thunder]] weakness. However, it is still relatively weak.

The '''Rakshasa''', also known as the '''ManCat''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], is an enemy from the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It is not a powerful enemy, but will try to inflict many status ailments to the entire [[party]], as they cast a wide array of spells, like [[Slow (ability)|slow]]. Wearing [[Ribbon (Final Fantasy)|Ribbons]] protects against these inflictions. Its most dangerous attack is [[Fira (ability)|Fira]], but that is negligible and they can still be taken care of with physical attacks alone.

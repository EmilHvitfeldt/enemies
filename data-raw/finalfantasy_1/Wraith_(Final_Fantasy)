The '''Wraith''', known as the '''IMAGE''' in the localized release of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. '''Wraith''' is also the name used in the original NES translation to refer to the [[Specter (Final Fantasy)|Specter]].

Like similar ghostly foes, the Wraith's touch causes [[Paralysis (Final Fantasy status)|Paralysis]]. It has the same vulnerabilities and resistances as most [[undead]] enemies, and thus a quick [[Fire (Final Fantasy)|Fire]] or [[Dia (Final Fantasy)|Dia]] spell defeats them, and [[Fira (Fira)|Fira]] can destroy an army of them.

It appears in the [[Cavern of Earth]] and in the [[Western Keep]], in a room with three chests, guarding the front of the center [[Treasure chest (object)|chest]]. They often appear in groups.

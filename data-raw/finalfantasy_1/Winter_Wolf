The '''Winter Wolf''', also known as the '''FrWOLF''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. Winter Wolves are the toughest of the wolf family, but are weak due to having zero [[Defense (stat)|Defense]] and an elemental weakness to [[Fire (Final Fantasy element)|Fire]]. Given that they appear with other [[Ice (Final Fantasy)|Ice]]-type monsters, a single [[Fira (Final Fantasy)|Fira]] can easily defeat an entire group. They can still be dangerous for the unprepared. Winter Wolves have a special attack called [[Snowstorm|Icestorm]], which deals Ice damage to all the [[party]] members. Despite its low damage, Winter Wolves tend to appear in large packs. [[NulFrost (Final Fantasy)|NulFrost]]—and taking the wolves out quickly—can cut down the damage they deal.

They appear as [[random encounter]]s in the [[Cavern of Ice]], attacking in large packs or along with a lone (or pair of) [[Ice Gigas (Final Fantasy)|Ice Gigas]]. They also appear in the second floor of the [[Chaos Shrine (Final Fantasy)|Chaos Shrine]], and around the cities of [[Lufenia (Final Fantasy)|Lufenia]], [[Pravoka]], and [[Onrac]], even of these are not snowy regions.

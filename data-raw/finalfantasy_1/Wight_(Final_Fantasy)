The '''Wight''', also known as the '''Specter''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. Wights is [[undead]] with the same weaknesses and resistances normal for undead enemies: [[Fire (element)|Fire]] and the [[Dia (ability)|Dia]] spell. A Wight's attack can cause [[Paralysis]], which can prove irritating if it affects a physical attacker.

Wight is fought in the [[Cavern of Earth]] and the [[Cavern of Ice]], the latter being only in a small room, forcing the player to fight them automatically. It is not difficult to defeat them, but they sometimes come in large groups.

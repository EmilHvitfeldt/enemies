The '''Sabertooth''', also known as '''Saber T''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version and '''Sabretooth''' in some non-American releases, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It appears around the city of [[Onrac]], and in the [[Mirage Tower]]. It appears with [[Lesser Tiger]]s, in groups of up to four felines (generally two Sabertooths and two Lesser Tigers). In the Mirage Tower, it is flanked by many [[Medusa (Final Fantasy)|Medusas]] in groups of up to six enemies.

Sabertooth is a normal enemy with no special abilities or resistances, so a normal attacking strategy should work, as it is not very strong either. If it appears with Medusas, they can [[Stone (Final Fantasy status)|petrify]] a character, so it is recommended to have some [[Gold Needle (Final Fantasy)|Gold Needle]]s.

The '''White Croc''', also known as the '''FrGATOR''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. White Crocs are much stronger than their cousins, the standard [[Crocodile (Final Fantasy)|Crocodiles]]. Unlike Crocodiles, White Crocs are adorned with white scales with purple back-ridges. Like Crocodiles and many other aquatic foes, they are weak to [[Lightning (element)|Lightning]]-based spells. A [[Thundara (Final Fantasy)|Thundara]] spell [[group-cast|spread out across the enemy group]] will usually not be powerful enough to kill a band of White Crocs, so a [[Thundaga (Final Fantasy)|Thundaga]] spell will be necessary for a one-hit KO.

They may appear in groups with [[Red Piranha (Final Fantasy)|Red Piranha]]s, or occasionally alone.

Despite its original name, White Croc is not affiliated with the [[Ice (element)|Ice]] element.

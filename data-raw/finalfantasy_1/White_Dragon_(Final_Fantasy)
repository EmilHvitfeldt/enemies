The '''White Dragon''', known as the '''Frost D''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. White Dragon appears later in the [[Chaos Shrine (Final Fantasy)|Chaos Shrine]], on the first floor. The dragon appears also in the [[Lifespring Grotto]], in a room where a dragon, [[Bahamut (Final Fantasy)|Dark Bahamut]], orders the party to kill some of its disciples to continue to the next level. One of the disciples may be the White Dragon, which the party can fight. They sometimes come in groups of up to four dragons.

== Battle ==
White Dragons are not as difficult to defeat as the [[Red Dragon (Final Fantasy)|Red Dragon]], having less [[HP (stat)|HP]], Attack, and stats overall; which is strange, because the party is supposed to visit the [[Cavern of Ice]] after the visit to [[Mount Gulg (Final Fantasy)|Mount Gulg]]. The White Dragon is of the [[Ice (Final Fantasy)|ice]] element, and thus is weak to [[Fire (Final Fantasy element)|fire]] attacks, and resists ice attacks. The dragon is also weak to [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|lightning]]. As with many winged enemies, the dragon is immune to [[Earth (Final Fantasy)|earth-element]] attacks, and it is also invulnerable to [[Poison (Final Fantasy)|poison]] and [[Stone (Final Fantasy)|stone]].

Even if the White Dragon is weaker than its red counterpart, it still has a trick up its sleeve: Icestorm, which deals ice damage to all [[party]] members, and can be dangerous for members with low [[Magic Defense (stat)|magic defense]].

=== Strategy ===
A single [[Firaga (ability)|Firaga]] will either finish it off or leave it very weak.

== Etymology ==
{{Etym|Dragon}}

{{Etym|Chromatic dragon}} White dragons are the weakest and the most feral of the classic chromatic dragons. They love to swim in cold water, lair in ice caves, and their icy breath can freeze a foe solid.

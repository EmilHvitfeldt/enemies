The '''White Shark''', also known as the '''GrSHARK''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], is an aquatic enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. White Sharks can be found in the [[Sunken Shrine]] as a [[random encounter]] enemy. Its high Magic Defense stat renders [[Thundara (Final Fantasy)|Thundara]] less effective against it than most other aquatic foes, but it is a good target for physical attacks because of its low Defense. White Sharks often comes in groups of two or with its lesser [[Shark (Final Fantasy)|Shark]] cousin.

== Etymology ==
{{Etym|Buccaneer}}

Buccaneer is called パイレーツ, ''pairētsu'', taken from the English word "pirates", and is used as a more exotic-sounding synonym of the same concept. This has posed issues in translating these two enemy terms into English. The 1990 NES version addressed this by swapping the terms in translation, with ''kaizoku'' becoming "Pirate" and ''pairētsu'' becoming "Kyzoku" (a phonetic spelling of ''kaizoku''). Later translations have continued translating ''kaizoku'' as "Pirate", but ''pairētsu'' is since become "Buccaneer" or "Privateer", which are more flowery terms for "pirate" in English, and this keeps with the spirit of the Japanese naming pattern.

== Battle ==
Garland solely relies on physical attacks throughout the battle.

=== Strategy ===
This is not a difficult fight to win, providing the player gets a [[Cure (Final Fantasy)|Cure]] spell for a [[White Mage (Final Fantasy)|White]] or [[Red Mage (Final Fantasy)|Red Mage]]. The [[Warrior (Final Fantasy)|Warrior]]/[[Thief (Final Fantasy)|Thief]]/[[Monk (Final Fantasy)|Monk]] should attack Garland head on while the [[Black Mage (Final Fantasy)|Black Mage]] uses any [[Magic (Final Fantasy)|spells]] they know and the White Mage cures when the [[party]] is injured.

If the party has two Black Magic users giving each a damaging spell will easily win the match in two turns, regardless of the party's [[level]].

== Other appearances ==
=== ''[[Final Fantasy All the Bravest]]'' ===
[[File:Garland ATB.png|right]] Garland is fought in Cornelia's Tract. He uses Sweep and drops the Enhancer weapon upon defeat. His description reads: ''"...You will die here and I will continue to live for eternity!"''

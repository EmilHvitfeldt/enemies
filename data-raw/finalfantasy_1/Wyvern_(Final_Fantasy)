The '''Wyvern''' is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It is the weaker cousin of the [[Wyrm (Final Fantasy)|Wyrm]] with lower stats. It is blue with red stripes and appears groups of up to four around [[Onrac]], with [[Allosaurus (Final Fantasy)|Allosaurus]] in the [[Yahnikurm Desert]], and with Wyrms on the second level of the [[Mirage Tower]]. Wyvern is a flying enemy immune to [[Quake (Final Fantasy)|Quake]]. It appears in large numbers with other strong enemies. but normal strategies work fine. The player's [[party]] should have [[Job system|upgraded classes]] by that point, so they are not a problem.

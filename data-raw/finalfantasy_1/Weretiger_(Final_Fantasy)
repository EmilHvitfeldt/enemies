The '''Weretiger''', known as the '''CATMAN''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version, is an enemy from the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It appears on the [[Cardian Islands|Bahamut Islands]], as well as on the first floor of the [[Mirage Tower]]. In the Bahamut Islands, they appear flanked by [[Sabertooth (Final Fantasy)|Sabertooth Tigers]], while in the Mirage Tower, they appear only with other Weretigers. Weretigers regenerate some [[HP (stat)|HP]] each turn, but are not hard to beat and the amount of HP they regain does not pose a threat. They also use Poison. When they appear in groups they may be a nuisance, as they resist magic.

The '''Remorazz''', also known as the '''GrPEDE''' and '''Remora''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[PlayStation]] ports, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It can be found at the [[Cavern of Ice]] and the wilderness surrounding the town of [[Onrac]].

Originally, the Nintendo Entertainment System version (the Great Pede) was green, while its lesser sibling, the [[Ankheg (Final Fantasy)|Ankheg]], was red. The PlayStation version (Remora) was re-colored blue. The [[Game Boy Advance]] version switched the colors around, so that the Ankheg is blue and the Remorazz is red (suggesting, possibly, that the Ankheg living in [[Mount Gulg (Final Fantasy)|Gurgu Volcano]] is cold-powered, and the Remorazz in the Cavern of Ice is fire-powered).

Remorazz resists both [[Fire (Final Fantasy element)|Fire]] and [[Ice (Final Fantasy element)|Ice]], and has high [[Magic Defense (stat)|Magic Defense]]. It hits hard compared to other local monsters. It usually appears alone, and does not have any special abilities. It is recommended to use [[Attack (command)|physical attacks]] to dispatch them.

In ''[[Pixel Remaster]]'', Remorazz gains resistance to [[Spirit (Final Fantasy)|Spirit]].

The '''Pyrolisk''', also known as '''Perilisk''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' found in [[Mount Gulg (Final Fantasy)|Mount Gulg]], and in the [[Mirage Tower]]. It is an easy monster in the Mirage Tower, because the [[party]] is more [[Level|leveled up]] by this point. In the [[Waterfall Cavern]], on the south part of this cave, there is a room with many [[Treasure chest (object)|chests]] and a robot; a group of Pyrolisks, Cockatrices, and [[Mummy (Final Fantasy)|Mummies]] guard the room.

While a frail foe, the Pyrolisk should nonetheless be dealt with quickly, as it can try to instantly kill a party member through its [[Gaze (Final Fantasy)|Gaze]] attack. [[Blizzara (Final Fantasy)|Blizzara]] can make short work of a group of Pyrolisks, and can be cast for free using the [[Black Robe (Final Fantasy)|Black Robe]].

In versions before ''[[Pixel Remaster]]'', Pyrolisk has 124 [[morale (Final Fantasy)|morale]], and only gains a chance to run away if the lead party member is Lv23 or higher.

== Battle ==
Pyrolisks appear in groups, and sometimes run away.

The Pyrolisk's physical attacks are slightly stronger than their cousin the [[Cockatrice (Final Fantasy)|Cockatrice]]'s, although they do not cause [[Stone (Final Fantasy status)|petrification]]. This does not mean Pyrolisks are unable to petrify the unwary; rather, the Pyrolisk uses its [[Gaze (ability)|Gaze]] skill to kill its enemies instantly, which the [[Gold Needle (Final Fantasy)|Gold Needle]] it [[Item drop|drops]] will most-assuredly not cure.

Despite being based on a creature that causes spontaneous combustion with its gaze, its Squint instant death ability is Death-elemental and not Fire-elemental, so only [[NulDeath (Final Fantasy)|NulDeath]] and gear with Death resistance will block its special ability.

Pyrolisks, being creatures of [[Fire (Final Fantasy element)|Fire]], are resistant to Fire-based magic but suffer a weakness from [[Ice (Final Fantasy element)|Ice]]-based magic. Even without Ice magic, they are not strong creatures and can be killed easily with strong physical attacks.

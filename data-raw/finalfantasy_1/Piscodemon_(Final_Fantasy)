The '''Piscodemon''', also known as the '''Wizard''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It guards [[Astos|Astos']] [[Crown (Final Fantasy)|crown]], as well as other locations:
* The space within the lowest left-hand door in the third basement, [[Marsh Cave]].
* Left side of a chest, found in the second room from the bottom, counting from the left. Marsh Cave, basement 3.
* Guarding a chest in the lower right hand corner. Marsh Cave, basement 3.

It is a tough enemy when encountered for the first time as its attacks inflict a large amount of damage and it is impossible to [[Flee|escape]] from. A [[Black Mage (Final Fantasy)|Black Mage]] who has learned [[Thundara (Final Fantasy)|Thundara]] from the [[Elfheim]] Magic Shop can make short work of it.

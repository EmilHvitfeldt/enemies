The '''Sahagin Chief''', also known as the '''R.SAHAG''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' and its remakes. They are often found in the company of regular [[Sahagin (Final Fantasy)|Sahagin]]. Chiefs are distinguished by their red scales. If there are one or two of them, the player should just [[Attack (command)|attack]], but if there are more, or the enemies add up to three or more, [[Thundara (Final Fantasy)|Thundara]] can dispose of an army of them. The Sahagins' physical attacks can add up, so it is best to defeat them quickly.

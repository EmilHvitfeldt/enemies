== Battle ==
[[File:Amano FF1 Evil Eye.png|Concept artwork of the monster's [[#Behind the scenes|original design]] by [[Yoshitaka Amano]].|thumb]]
The Evil Eye does not have any specific weaknesses, so the party can simply [[Attack (command)|attack]] physically with a [[Thief (Final Fantasy)|Thief]]/[[Monk (Final Fantasy)|Monk]]/[[Warrior (Final Fantasy)|Warrior]] while using [[Haste (Final Fantasy)|Haste]] on them, if available. The player's highest grade [[Magic (Final Fantasy)|magic]] can be used to harm it while healing as necessary. The Evil Eye should not be too hard due to its low [[HP (stat)|HP]] level, which ensures an easy battle if physical tactics are devised. It is, however, recommended to defeat it quickly, as the longer the fight goes on the more likely it is to use abilities that can possibly kill the entire party.

In versions prior to WSC, it has a high chance of using its instant death and petrify abilities immediately, so the fight should be ended as soon as possible.

===Level grinding===
Prior to ''[[Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster|Pixel Remaster]]'', the Evil Eye in the Cavern of Ice is found one step before the stone and must be battled to obtain the key item. It can be fought as many times as the player's [[party]] wants, because it does not disappear from its position after being defeated. The player can move to another adjacent tile, and then return to fight the Evil Eye again for [[level grinding]] purposes, as it gives out a considerable amount of [[experience point]]s upon defeat. If the party has [[Protect Ring (Final Fantasy)|Protect Rings]], the Eye becomes a relatively safe source of quick experience due its [[Instant Death (Final Fantasy)|Instant Death]] actions always missing. However, it may still inflict [[Stone (Final Fantasy status)|Stone]].

In ''Pixel Remaster'', the Cavern of Ice encounter is instead a one-time trigger when the player interacts with the Levistone and cannot be farmed.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:EYE from FFI Famicom sprite.png|thumb|Sprite from the Famicom release.]]
In the original Japanese version, the EYE and its palette swap the [[PHANTOM (Final Fantasy)|PHANTOM]] greatly resembled a [[wikipedia:Beholder (Dungeons & Dragons)|Beholder]] from ''Dungeons & Dragons'', and was even called Beholder {{J|ビホルダー|Bihorudā}}. Outside of Japan, and for all ports after the MSX version, the design and name were drastically changed, likely due to copyright concerns. The original Beholder design would not be used again until ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy (2008)|Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'', where it was used for a [[Dissidia Final Fantasy (2008) player icons|player icon]].

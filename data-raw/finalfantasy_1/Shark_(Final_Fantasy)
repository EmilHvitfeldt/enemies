The '''Shark''' is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It appears in groups of two or alone. Due to its high Attack power, it is the most dangerous enemy in the [[Aldean Sea|ocean]] when the [[Final Fantasy characters#The Light Warriors|Warriors of Light]] first set sail on their [[ship]]. Every version of the sprite is facing right, instead of left like in the original drawing.

Physical attacks work well, but if the player struggles, [[Thunder (Final Fantasy)|Thunder]] may be better (or, if there are more than one, [[Thundara (Final Fantasy)|Thundara]]). Shark is the strongest enemy in the game at the point where the party first obtains the ship, so it's advised to head straight for [[Elfheim]] not worrying about fights until the party has purchased Thundara.

The '''Shadow''' is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. Its attacks may cause [[Final Fantasy statuses#Darkness|darkness]], which may be troublesome if it hits the party's physical attackers. It appears in large groups, along with other [[undead]] enemies. Casting [[Dia (Final Fantasy)|Dia]] or [[Fire (Final Fantasy)|Fire]] is the best tactic, and [[Firaga (Final Fantasy)|Firaga]] can easily take out a group of Shadows and similar undead enemies.

It can be rarely found near the town of [[Melmond]] but are commonly found inside [[Marsh Cave]].

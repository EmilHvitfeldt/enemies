The '''Sea Troll''' is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It is a water-based enemy and regenerates a small amount of [[HP (stat)|HP]] each turn. They are otherwise easy to dispatch. Due to a [[Graphical bug|glitch]] in the NES version, occasionally the Sea Troll's sprite will be a lighter color than intended.

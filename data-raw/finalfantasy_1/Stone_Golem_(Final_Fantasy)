The '''Stone Golem''', also known as '''RockGol''', is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. Like other Golems, it is resistant to all [[status effect]]s and [[Element (term)|elements]]. [[Attack (command)|Physical attacks]] are best, despite the enemy's armored appearance.

If not dealt with quickly, fights with it can actually drag on, since it can inflict [[Final Fantasy statuses#Slow|Slow]] and reduce your party's attack rate. Regardless of whether you choose to engage it physically or with magic, it is best to deal with it quickly as a result. Fortunately, it is somewhat weak for how late in the game it appears.

{{Quote|All living things are born to die. No one can defeat me, the Vampire!!|Vampire}}
The '''Vampire''' is a [[boss]] from the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', fought on the third floor of the [[Cavern of Earth]]. When the [[Final Fantasy characters|Light Warriors]] arrive to [[Melmond]], they find the earth rotting and the people suffering. As the Vampire had attacked the town earlier and destroyed the [[church]], the townsfolk believe he was also responsible for the earth rotting. The Light Warriors travel to the Cavern of Earth to confront him.

After defeating him they find out the land in Melmond keeps rotting, and thus they go to the [[Sadda (Final Fantasy)|Sage's]] cave, where they discover the Vampire was working for one of the [[Four Fiends (Final Fantasy)|Four Fiends]], the [[Lich (Final Fantasy)|Lich]].

Other Vampires are fought as [[random encounter]]s in numerous areas. They can be fought in the [[Mirage Tower]] in groups, and alongside other enemies in parts of the [[Chaos Shrine (Final Fantasy)|Chaos Shrine]]. In ''[[Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls]]'' up to ''[[Final Fantasy 20th Anniversary|20th Anniversary Edition]]'', the Vampire of Melmond can be found and battled again in the room of spirits in the [[Whisperwind Cove (Final Fantasy)|Whisperwind Cove]].

== Battle ==
At the point the boss is faced, his 280 [[HP (stat)|HP]] is weak; he even has less HP than the [[Earth Elemental (Final Fantasy)|Earth Elemental]], which appears as a random encounter in the same cave. His regenerating and [[Gaze (Final Fantasy)|Gaze]] attack can be tricky, but he is not a challenge. Using [[Fire (Final Fantasy element)|Fire]]-based attacks or casting [[Dia (ability)|Dia]] can help end the battle quickly; a lucky shot with [[Firaga (Final Fantasy)|Firaga]] or [[Diaga (Final Fantasy)|Diaga]], particularly in the NES version, can end the fight in a single spell.

=== Whisperwind Cove encounter ===
{{Quote|Forgive me, [[Lich (Final Fantasy)|Lich]]...|Vampire}}
Whisperwind Cove has a room with restless souls of various monsters who had died. The player can find the Vampire of Melmond's soul, as well as that of [[Astos]]. The Vampire recognizes the Warriors of Light and attacks them, but as he retains the same level of power as before, he is no match for the stronger Warriors. After this second defeat, the Vampire begs the Lich for forgiveness before disappearing for good.

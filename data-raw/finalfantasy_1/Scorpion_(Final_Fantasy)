The '''Scorpion''' is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. When encountered in the [[Marsh Cave]] it is extremely powerful relative to the [[party]]'s [[level]]. It's advised to hit it as hard as possible while casting [[Heal (ability)|Heal]]. Its attacks may inflict [[Poison (status)|Poison]], so it is advised to carry lots of [[Antidote (item)|Antidotes]] before traveling through the [[Mount Gulg (Final Fantasy)|Mount Gulg]] volcano. It is otherwise easy to defeat at this point in the game.

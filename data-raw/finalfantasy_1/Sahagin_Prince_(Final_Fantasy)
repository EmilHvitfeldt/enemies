The '''Sahagin Prince''', also known as the '''WzSahag''' and the '''Sahagin Priest''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] and the [[Game Boy Advance|GBA]] versions, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It is found in the [[Sunken Shrine]] and the [[Lifespring Grotto]].

Sahagin Prince is a blue palette swap of the [[Sahagin (Final Fantasy)|original Sahagin]]. In the NES version the color scheme is the other way around. Also, despite the name in the NES version, it does not use spells. Sahagin Princes come in large packs, sometimes over seven. They are individually weak and a whole group can be defeated with a [[Thundara (Final Fantasy)|Thundara]] spell.

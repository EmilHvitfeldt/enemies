The '''Wolf''' is an enemy from the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It attacks in large groups, sometimes alongside [[Warg Wolf (Final Fantasy)|Warg Wolves]], and can easily defeat a [[party]] that has just begun; [[level]]ing up two or three times should help the party overcome them easily. Wolves are found around [[Cornelia (Final Fantasy)|Cornelia]] and in grassy areas near the beginning of the game. Since they are encountered before [[Group-cast|multi-targeting magic]] is available, defeating them can be somewhat painful. The [[Magic (Final Fantasy)|Black Magic]] spell Sleep can make early fights with them easier.

The '''Sphinx''' is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It appears in the fourth floor of the [[Cavern of Earth]], guarding two [[Treasure chest (object)|chests]]. The Sphinx also appears frequently as a [[random encounter]] in [[Mount Gulg (Final Fantasy)|Mount Gulg]]. In the Earth Cave, they are moderately hard enemies as they may appear in groups, but they are not so difficult when compared to the much harder enemies there, like the [[Earth Elemental (Final Fantasy)|Earth Elemental]].

The '''Troll''' is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It is found in the [[Cavern of Earth]], and around certain [[town]]s, such as [[Onrac]] and [[Lufenia (Final Fantasy)|Lufenia]]. In sprites and concept art the Troll is shown clutching its head. A friendly soul of a Troll in the [[Whisperwind Cove (Final Fantasy)|Whisperwind Cove]] dungeon in [[Soul of Chaos (Final Fantasy)|Soul of Chaos]] moans about its head aching. This refers to some folklore on trolls saying they suffer from a constant ringing in their ears.

== Battle ==
Troll can hit up to three times in a single attack and regenerate a portion of its [[HP (stat)|health]] each turn. It is not hard to defeat, and is weak in comparison to other monsters in the Cavern of Earth, such as the [[Earth Elemental (Final Fantasy)|Earth Elemental]] or the [[Hill Gigas (Final Fantasy)|Hill Gigas]].

=== Strategy ===
The player should use physical attacks and [[Fire (Final Fantasy element)|Fire]] spells, if the [[Black Mage (Final Fantasy)|Black]] or [[Red Mage (Final Fantasy)|Red]] Mages in the [[party]] have it. [[Cure (Final Fantasy)|Cure]] is not typically necessary.

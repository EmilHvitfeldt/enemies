The '''Red Dragon''', abbreviated to '''Red D''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It is the first dragon the [[Final Fantasy characters#The Light Warriors|Warriors of Light]] meet and is fairly difficult when first encountered.

The most famous guardian in [[Mount Gulg (Final Fantasy)|Mount Gulg]], the Red Dragon is guarding a [[Treasure chest (object)|chest]] with [[Flame Mail (Final Fantasy)|Flame Mail]], which may come handy in the fight with [[Marilith (Final Fantasy)|Marilith]]. Long after Mount Gulg, the player may find the Red Dragon (among other [[dragon]]s) in the [[Lifespring Grotto]] [[bonus dungeon|optional dungeon]] (which is not available in every version of ''Final Fantasy''). There, [[Bahamut (Final Fantasy)|Dark Bahamut]] gives the heroes the task of defeating a certain number of his dragon disciples.

Red Dragon uses [[Blaze (ability)|Blaze]], which deals [[Fire (Final Fantasy element)|Fire]]-based damage to all [[party]] members. It is also physically powerful. Having the [[Mage (job)|mages]] cast [[Ice (Final Fantasy)|ice]]-based [[Magic (Final Fantasy)|spells]] and strong physical attacks can defeat a Red Dragon with ease.

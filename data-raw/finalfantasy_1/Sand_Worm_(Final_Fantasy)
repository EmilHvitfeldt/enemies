The '''Sand Worm''', also known as the '''Sand W''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It is a rare enemy that appears in every northern desert as well as the [[Cardian Islands]], also known as Bahamut Islands. It appears in groups of up to two enemies. It can also appear very rarely on the lowest floor of the [[Flying Fortress]] only in the ''Pixel Remaster'' version.

Sand Worm has overall low stats, but its attacks can cause [[Poison (Final Fantasy status)|Poison]] and they use [[Earthquake (Final Fantasy)|Earthquake]] to try for an [[Earth (Final Fantasy)|earth-element]] [[KO (Final Fantasy)|instant kill]] on the whole party. It is recommended to just use regular attacks.

The Sand Worm is possibly a reference to the giant sandworms from the sci-fi novel ''Dune'', by Frank Herbert. It could also be a reference to the unconfirmed real-life cryptic creature called the "Mongolian Death Worm".

The '''Specter''', also known as the '''WRAITH''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] version, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. In the [[Game Boy Advance]] ''[[Dawn of Souls]]'' remake, the Specter and the [[Wraith (Final Fantasy)|Wraith]] are two different enemies. "Specter" is also the name used in the original NES translation to refer to the [[Wight (Final Fantasy)|Wight]].

They only appear as common random encounters in Basement Floors 1 and 2 of the [[Cavern of Ice]]. When the party falls down through a hole in B2F, they land in a small room, where they must fight groups of Specters, Wraiths, and [[Ghast (Final Fantasy)|Ghasts]] to escape.

As with all [[undead]] enemies, Specters are weak to [[Fire (ability)|Fire]] and [[Dia (ability)|Dia]] attacks. Like the other ghost-type enemies, its physical attacks may cause [[Paralysis]]. Strong physical attacks will work as well, due to their low [[Stats|HP]].

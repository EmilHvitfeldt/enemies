The '''Wyrm''' is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It is an upgraded version of the [[Wyvern (Final Fantasy)|Wyvern]], having slightly higher stats than its blue cousin, and appears around [[Onrac]] and the [[Mirage Tower]]. Around Onrac they come in groups up to four; in the [[Mirage Tower]] they come with Wyverns. [[KO (Final Fantasy)|Instant defeat]] spells, like [[Quake (Final Fantasy)|Quake]], will miss because the Wyrm is flying.

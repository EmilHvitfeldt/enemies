The '''Sahagin''', also known as the '''SAHAG''' in the [[NES]] version, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It appears in the sea, when the player is navigating with the [[ship]]. They are notorious for their high Agility level. They attack with a weak physical attack, and should not be hard to defeat. They appear in groups, so a quick [[Thundara (Final Fantasy)|Thundara]] will destroy them all with ease.

'''Skeleton''', known as '''BONE''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version, is an enemy in the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It appears in packs with the same type of enemies, or occasionally with other monsters, but does not pose a threat if the player has [[level]]ed up sufficiently. Since it is susceptible to [[Dia (Final Fantasy)|Dia]] and [[Fire (Final Fantasy element)|Fire]], casting either should finish it off easily.

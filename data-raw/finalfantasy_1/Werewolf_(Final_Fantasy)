The '''Werewolf''', known as the '''WereWOLF''' in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version, is an enemy from the original ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. It is a palette swap of the original [[Wolf (Final Fantasy)|Wolf]], possessing a green back instead of a yellow one. They commonly appear in packs along with Wolves and [[Warg Wolf (Final Fantasy)|Warg Wolves]].

If they attack in a group, the Werewolf can prove troublesome for a weaker team, particularly if they are encountered near [[Matoya's Cave (Final Fantasy)|Matoya's Cave]] early in the game. It regenerates three [[HP (stat)|HP]] each turn and its attacks may inflict the [[Poison (Final Fantasy status)|Poison]] status effect on a [[party]] member.

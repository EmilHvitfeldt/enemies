The '''Iron Golem''', also known as the '''IronGOL''' or '''IRONGOL'''<ref name="Enemy Identification Chart"/>, is an enemy in ''[[Final Fantasy]]''. The sturdiest of golems in the base game, it is extremely rare, found only on floor B4 of the [[Chaos Shrine (Final Fantasy)|Chaos Shrine]]. It has only a 1/64 chance of appearing in pre-''[[Pixel Remaster]]'' releases, making it one of the rarest enemies in the game; its chance of appearing is greatly increased in the ''Pixel Remaster''.

{{annotations}}

== Battle ==
The Iron Golem can be extremely dangerous for parties who venture into the Chaos Shrine unprepared. It can use [[Deadly Gas]], an [[instant Death (Final Fantasy)|Instant Death]] element attack that targets the whole party, killing any members who do not resist; this is particularly dangerous in the ''Pixel Remaster'' release, where it has a much greater chance using Deadly Gas. [[Protect Ring (Final Fantasy)|Protect Ring]]s and [[Ribbon (Final Fantasy)|Ribbons]] will help ensure survival, as will [[NulDeath (Final Fantasy)|NulDeath]]. Having much better physical [[Defense (stat)|defense]] compared to the previous two golems, as well as the usual elemental resistances, the [[Flare (Final Fantasy)|Flare]] spell is the most effective against this enemy.
